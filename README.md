# ToDoList

#### 📝 **Description**

This is a ToDo List application built using the VIPER architecture. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and search tasks, while maintaining data persistence with Core Data. At first launch, the app fetches tasks from a remote JSON API, then stores them locally for future use. All background operations (loading, creating, editing, deleting, and searching tasks) are handled using GCD to ensure a smooth user experience.

#### 🛠 **Technologies**

* Swift + UIKit
* VIPER Architecture
* Core Data (for local storage)
* GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) (for background processing)
* XCTest (for unit testing)
